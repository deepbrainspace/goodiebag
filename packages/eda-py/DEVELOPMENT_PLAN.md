## 🐛 Known Issues & Risks

### Current Risks
- **Claude API Rate Limits**: Relationship extraction may be slow
- **Embedding Costs**: Large conversation history could be expensive
- **File Format Changes**: Claude Code JSONL format might evolve
- **Memory Usage**: Vector storage might require optimization

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Batch Processing**: Process relationships in chunks
- **Caching**: Cache embeddings and relationship extractions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle missing/corrupted files
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic features, add intelligence

## 📝 Session Notes

### 2025-06-25 - Foundation Complete ✅
- ✅ Created project structure and documentation  
- ✅ Implemented local SurrealDB setup with schema
- ✅ Built file monitor with duplicate detection
- ✅ Created test ingestion script
- ✅ **SUCCESS**: Parsed 137+ conversation files across 9 projects
- ✅ **DISCOVERY**: Claude Code creates new files after 6-13 hour gaps (auth cycles)
- ✅ **COMMIT**: Major milestone committed to git
- 🔄 **NEXT**: Fix SurrealDB connection and complete database ingestion

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Apps vs Packages**: EDA is a standalone service, so placed in `apps/eda/`
2. **Local Testing**: Use file-based SurrealDB for fast development iteration
3. **Duplicate Detection**: Use file metadata + content hash to avoid reprocessing
4. **File Monitoring**: Real-time watching + batch processing for existing files

### Architecture Insights Discovered
- Claude Code creates new conversation files after 6-13 hour gaps (likely token refresh cycles)
- Files can be updated (same session) or created new (new session)
- Each project gets its own directory with UUID-named JSONL files
- JSONL format contains conversation turns with timestamps and metadata

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Test Current Implementation**
   ```bash
   cd apps/eda
   python test_ingestion.py
   ```

2. **Analyze Results**
   - How many conversations were parsed?
   - What's the data quality like?
   - Any parsing errors to fix?

3. **Improve Conversation Parsing**
   - Handle conversation pairing (user → assistant)
   - Extract better metadata
   - Add data validation

4. **Add Relationship Extraction**
   - Integrate Claude API
   - Design relationship extraction prompts
   - Test on sample conversations

## 🔄 Review Schedule

- **Daily**: Check progress against current phase
- **Weekly**: Update success metrics and adjust timeline
- **Monthly**: Review overall architecture and add new phases
