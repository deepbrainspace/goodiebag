# Balance Command

Check Claude usage and billing information for the current month.

## Task:

1. **Check current usage status**:
   - Display current billing period and usage
   - Show tokens used vs available limits
   - Report any rate limiting or quota information
   - Indicate days remaining in billing cycle

2. **Pro plan details** (if applicable):
   - Monthly limit: $100
   - Current spend this month
   - Usage percentage
   - Estimated remaining capacity

3. **Usage breakdown**:
   - Requests made this session
   - Model usage (Sonnet vs Opus)
   - Heavy vs light operations

4. **Recommendations**:
   - Suggest ways to optimize usage if approaching limits
   - Recommend model switching if applicable
   - Provide tips for efficient Claude usage

**Note**: This command relies on Claude's ability to access current usage information. If detailed billing data isn't available, provide general usage guidance and suggest checking the Anthropic dashboard directly.
